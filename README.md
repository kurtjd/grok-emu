# grok-emu
**grok**: /grok/, /grohk/, vt.  
*To understand. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. When you claim to ‘grok’ some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity.*

This repository represents my attempt to grok various systems (mainly of the 8-bit era) through accurate emulation. The goal is to design different components in a modular and flexible way such that they can be freely reused by multiple systems and by others looking to grok these systems as well.
